# Coding exercise 5:

Coding exercise from a frontend perspective: Healthcare providers request to be part of the Availity system.  Using React framework, create a registration user interface so healthcare providers can electronically join Availity.  The following data points should be collected:
First and Last Name
NPI number
Business Address
Telephone Number
Email address

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
